/*
   Note that COINBASE_PREORDER_DATA_CODE is the button code from
   coinbase.com/merchant_tools, used for the Preorder Button.  This is
   different from the COINBASE_API key in .env file, which is from
   coinbase.com/account/integrations

   The button code can be shown publicly, while the API key should only be
   included in a .env file and never shown publicly.  The former allows
   people to send you money, the latter allows people to send money from
   your account.

   For FUNDING_UNIT_SYMBOL, we use mBTC to represent 1/1000 of a Bitcoin and
   FUNDING_SI_SCALE for the corresponding multiplier.

   Note that for FUNDING_UNIT_SYMBOL, in theory we could use the Thai Baht
   symbol, but then we'd have to change the font.  If you use another
   payment backend, you can substitute "$" for the dollar or use one of the
   other currency symbols.
